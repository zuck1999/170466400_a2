    <h1>Machine Learning</h1>
    <p1> Course description- This course provide an introduction to the fundamental methods at the core of modern machine learning. It covers theoretical foundations as well as essential algorithms in learning statistical pattern recognition and analyzing data in science and engineering.

    Topics include: generative/discriminative learning, parametric/non-parametric learning, neural networks, and support vector machines.

    <p>Professors Bio - Ada Lovelace is an English born mathmatiction and computer scientist who was the first to recognise that machines had applications beyond pure calculation, she went on to publish the first algorithm intended to be carried out by such a machine. <p>
