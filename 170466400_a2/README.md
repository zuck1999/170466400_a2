# Question 1 for Assignment 2 (0.5%)

This question will help you practice your knowledge of website file structures,
as we discussed in class.

If you need a refresher, go here

> Don't overthink the solution for this section. It's very simple. It's exactly as I describe it: all you have to do is rename and move around folders and files. Do exactly as explained in class when I went over the solution for A1Q1. This is not a trick question.

# Description
In this repo you will find a few folders and files. There are a few sub folders, and you must look at each of them. Most folders have README.txt files.

README.txt files give a description of what's inside of the folders or a description of the folder.

All the files are empty, i.e., .html files are empty, .png images are empty, etc., etc. Again, none of the files have any content. **This is expected**.

Most files and folders are named incorrectly, if you compare their names to our naming guide for websites.

For example, 's2' could be interpreted to mean 'section 2 of something.'

# Your Solution for Question 1
Your job is to create a proper folder structure that could be deployed as a website, exactly as I described in class when I went over the solution for A1Q1.

It's a small website, with three sections: resume, projects, and products.

> To reiterate, all you have to do is create a structure similar to what we have done in class. 

This is just an exercise to move files around and renaming them to look like a proper website and get and easy 0.5% mark.

You do have to think a bit: for example, what should you rename a file called 'js.js'? 
> Hint: look at the context of where it is (or it should be) and then rename it accordingly.

Your solution should be inside a folder 'q1' and then have a 'www' root with properly named sub directories and properly named files.
